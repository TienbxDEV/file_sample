00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.240
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.000
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.740
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.130
And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580
They are known...

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.280
...as Hunters!

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.020
<b>Departure x And x Friends</b>

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.520
Whale Island

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.880
Gon's still trying to catch the Lord of the Lake?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.840
Huh?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.520
Y-Yes...

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.220
He's been at it for a week, non-stop.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.700
You promised he could take the Hunter Exam 
if he caught the Lord of the Lake?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.510
What a fool!

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.980
Five adults couldn't manage to 
reel in that monster.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.550
How is a child supposed to catch that beast?

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.230
Mito-san doesn't want him 
taking the Hunter Exam.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.790
But Gon's old man was the same age 
when he caught it...

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.880
He can't do it.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.170
Got him!

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.140
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.170
I got him good!

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.690
It's huge!

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.580
This is the Lord of the Lake?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.070
It's been twenty years!

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.360
I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.050
He's his father's son.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.940
Gon actually caught the Lord!

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.060
Look, Mito-san!

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.630
Mito-san!

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.200
I caught the Lord, as promised...

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.240
So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.700
Right?

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.700
I'll do my best.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.710
I promise to become a Hunter!

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.790
It must be in the blood...

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.780
No one has been able to catch the Lord

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.000
after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.980
And now his son has accomplished 
the same feat, at the same age.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.010
His eyes have the same shine as his father's.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.940
We can no longer stop him.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.700
Are you sure about this, Gon?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.720
Uh-huh.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.950
Your father abandoned you 
when you were still young

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.730
to become a Hunter.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.950
I know.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.590
He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.940
Isn't that amazing?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.740
Huh?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.480
Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.880
to abandon his own kid!

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.850
It's a dangerous job!

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.880
You never know when you might lose your life!

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.370
Don't you understand?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.860
I don't.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.390
But I want to know more!

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.390
I want to become a Hunter and discover why

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.550
it was so important to my dad!

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.050
You really are Ging's son...

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.460
I promise I'll pass the exam.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.520
I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.520
Just promise that you'll come back safe.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.530
Can you do that?

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.070
Uh-huh, I promise!

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.540
Pinky swear made...

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.520
Whoever breaks their promise has 
to swallow a thousand needles.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:56.940
Sealed with a kiss!

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.040
Gon...

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.780
Thank you, Mito-san.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.320
Good luck!

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.740
Knock 'em dead!

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.570
I'm going to become the 
best Hunter in the world!

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:53.890
Once I'm the best Hunter 
in the world, I'll come back!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.700
The best Hunter in the world?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.580
Kid doesn't respect us.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.690
Every year, there are millions of skilled 
applicants for the Hunter Exam.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.100
But only a handful are selected.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.210
Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.610
What are you doing, Katsuo?

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.620
At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.310
Why are you bent over?

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.890
Hey, losers!

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.510
Don't slack off!

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.900
A-Aye, sir!

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.900
Hey...

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.330
Didn't you hear me?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.540
Move that box!

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.920
A-Aye, Captain!

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.140
Hold on.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.540
Thanks!

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.550
A storm's coming.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.940
How can you tell, boy?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.120
That's what the seagulls are saying.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.230
What?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.160
Plus...

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.680
It's a huge storm that's coming!

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.680
It's true...

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.190
I can tell by the smell!

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.190
<i>That boy...</i>

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.010
<i>Those eyes...</i>

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.200
<i>Could he be...</i>

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480
Captain!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.040
The mast won't last much longer!

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.540
We should lower the sails!

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.010
Don't be stupid!

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.520
The fun's about to start.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.730
Here we go!

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.500
Full to port!

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.670
Let's fly!

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:55.990
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.990
<b>Gon</b>

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.140
Those waves weren't much...

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.260
Hey, take the helm.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.570
A-Aye!

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.250
Damn, this is one lousy crew.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.420
Not a one of them can stand.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.220
Pathetic.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.160
And they're supposed to be 
taking the Hunter Examination.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.560
What a laugh!

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.390
Here are some herbs.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.320
If you chew them, you'll feel a little better.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.670
W-Water...

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.900
It's coming, so hold on.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.400
That boy...

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.420
This is one sour apple...

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.590
<i>I see.</i>

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.190
<i>There are a few tough nuts on board.</i>

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.110
Excuse me!

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.330
H-Here is your water!

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.930
Thanks.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.310
Now drink your fill.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.790
Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.720
First, tell me your names.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.410
I'm Gon!

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.270
I'm Kurapika.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.830
It's Leorio.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.420
Why do you want to become Hunters?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.080
Hey! If you're not an examiner, 
you can't boss us around!

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.600
Just answer the question!

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.610
My dad is a Hunter.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.110
I left Whale Island because I want to know

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.480
why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.330
<i>Whale Island...</i>

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.140
<i>So this is Ging's son.</i>

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.930
<i>The day has finally come.</i>

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.140
Hey, kid!

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.860
Huh?

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.560
You're not supposed to answer his question!

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.930
Why can't I tell him why I'm here?

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.310
Not a team player, huh?

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.360
I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.770
I agree with Leorio.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.640
What?

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.200
Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.110
Show some respect!

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.550
It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.100
by offering a plausible lie.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.020
Hey! Are you listening to me?

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.720
However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.990
That said, if I were to tell you the truth,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:49.300
I would be exposing my deepest secrets.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.230
That is why I cannot provide an answer.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.440
Hey, you... Don't ignore me!

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.420
In other words, 
you refuse to answer my question.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.720
Hey, Katsuo.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.810
Aye, Captain.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.820
Tell the examination board that 
we have two more dropouts.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.820
What do you mean?

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.050
You still haven't figured it out?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.320
The Hunter Examination has already begun.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.540
What?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.510
There are as many Hunter wannabes

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.900
as there are stars in the sky.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:32.710
The examiners don't have the time or 
resources to review them all.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.720
So they hire people like us, to trim the fat.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.560
I've already notified the board

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.090
that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.620
If they couldn't handle a little storm,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.360
they'd stand no chance in the 
Hunter Examination's later stages.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:59.430
In other words, you only proceed to 
the main exam if I pass you.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.730
So think carefully before you answer my question.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.220
So he says...

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.120
Should have told us sooner.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.890
I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.260
Four years ago, my clan was annihilated 
by a band of criminals.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.370
I wish to become a Hunter and 
hunt down that band,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.900
the Phantom Troupe.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.880
So you want to become a bounty hunter?

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.410
The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.640
Not even the most grizzled Hunters 
can touch them.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.480
You'd be throwing away your life.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.760
I do not fear death.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.790
I fear only that my rage

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.200
will fade over time.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.810
So, in other words, you want revenge.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.800
Does that require that you become a Hunter?

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.020
That may be the stupidest question 
I've ever heard, Leorio.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.540
That's Leorio-san to you!

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.540
Places accessible only to Hunters...

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.010
Information otherwise unobtainable...

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.670
Actions otherwise impossible...

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.200
There are more reasons than your 
brain could possibly handle.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.050
Hey!

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.150
Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.000
Me?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.280
I'll make it short.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.420
I want money.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.830
Money can get you everything!

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.330
A big house!

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.840
A nice car!

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.340
Good liquor!

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.420
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.980
That's three times now.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.210
Step outside.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.330
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.420
Take that back, Leorio!

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.390
Take that back!

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.010
That's Leorio-san to you.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.590
Hey, boys!

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.820
I'm not finished yet!

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.930
Just let them go.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.510
Huh?

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.850
Mito-san once told me...

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.740
<i>If you want to get to know someone,</i>

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.750
<i>you need to make an effort</i>

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.060
<i>to learn why they're angry.</i>

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.900
It's important for them to 
understand why they're mad.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.390
So we should let them settle it themselves.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.220
Captain!

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.270
L-Look...

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.670
If we get caught by that waterspout, 
the ship will sink.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.420
Lower the sails now.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.070
Aye!

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.430
I'll help!

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.170
Uh-huh, come with me.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.990
I'll take the helm.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.660
Aye!

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.160
Full to starboard!

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.230
Hurry!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.190
The waterspout is gonna catch us!

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.620
Take back what you said!

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.690
Take back your words, 
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.210
How many times must I repeat myself?

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.940
You should show me some respect.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.330
I won't back down.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.050
Then I have no choice...

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.320
Katsuo-san!

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.230
Damn it!

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.810
Pull 'em out! Now...

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.140
You idiot!

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.980
If we hadn't grabbed your legs,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.670
you'd be shark bait now.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.120
Honestly...

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.030
How reckless can you be?

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.180
But you did catch me.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.070
Huh?

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.910
You both caught me!

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.750
Well, I guess so...

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.200
Gon!

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.230
Katsuo-san!

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.660
Thanks, Gon!

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.440
You saved my life.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.610
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.930
These two helped save you.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.830
Huh?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.200
Thank you very much!

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.070
No, you don't need to thank me.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.140
Well...

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.070
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.370
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.080
What?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.060
I apologize for my rude behavior.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.090
Sorry, Leorio-san.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.130
Wh-What's with the sudden change?

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.620
We sound like strangers...

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.100
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.500
I'm also sorry.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.420
I take back everything I said.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.340
I was wrong.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.430
No, it's okay.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.250
I like you guys!

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.750
Okay!

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.630
I'll take responsibility for bringing

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.550
you three to the port closest to the exam site.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.490
Really?

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.780
What about your test?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.890
Like I said...

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.320
It's my decision to make.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.010
And all three of you pass!

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.620
Yay!

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.590
And so began Gon's journey...

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.190
To follow in his father's footsteps 
and become a Hunter.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.620
Next time: Test x Of x Tests.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.720
Look forward to it!
